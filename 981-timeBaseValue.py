# The // operator in Python is used for integer (or floor) division.
# the result is "floored" to the nearest integer.

# # Integer division
# print(10 // 3)    # Output: 3 (because 10 รท 3 = 3.33, but the floor is 3)
# print(20 // 4)    # Output: 5 (because 20 รท 4 = 5, and it's already an integer)

# # Division with negative numbers
# print(-10 // 3)   # Output: -4 (because the result is floored to the next lower integer)

# # Float division (but still returns a floored value)
# print(10.5 // 3)  # Output: 3.0 (because 10.5 รท 3 = 3.5, but the floor is 3.0)
# print(10 // 3.0)  # Output: 3.0 (same as above, but with one operand as float)

# # Negative float division
# print(-10.5 // 3) # Output: -4.0 (because it floors down to -4.0)
