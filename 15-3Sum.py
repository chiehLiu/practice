    # Approach: Two Pointers
    # 1. Sort the array
    # 2. Iterate over the array and for each element a, find the two sum of the remaining array
    # 3. Use two pointers to find the two sum
    # 4. If the sum is greater than 0, decrement the right pointer
    # 5. If the sum is less than 0, increment the left pointer
    # 6. If the sum is 0, add the triplet to the result
    # 7. Skip the duplicates
    # 8. Return the result
